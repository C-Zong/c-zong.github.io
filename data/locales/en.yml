    - Welcome to my little space on the web!
    - I'm a senior majoring in Computer Science at OSU and will graduate in May 2026.
    - After that, I plan to work in the industry for a year before applying to graduate school for Fall 2027.
    - I hope to get some hands-on experience and explore what excites me most in tech.
    - Feel free to scroll down and get to know me better!

        Completed courses in Java, assembly language, web application development, and computer networks.<br><br>
        Planned courses: Game Animation, Artificial Intelligence, Principles of Programming Languages (CSE 3341), and Databases.<br><br>
        Built a simple budget tracker in Java (see GitHub repo profolio-2231). It wasn't very practical, but it helped me understand Java structure better. Also used Makefiles to simplify packaging and wrote simple assembly code.
        From the web application development course, I learned Git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Middleman, and Ruby on Rails, and worked in a Linux (Ubuntu) virtual machine environment. The course was a bit stressful, but I gained a lot of hands-on experience. Most of the team projects must remain private, but I plan to create personal projects to showcase the skills I learned.
        For computer networks, the many technical terms were challenging‚ÄîI wasn't confident with my English and memory. Even though I earned a good grade, I have to admit I've forgotten quite a bit since then üòÖ.

        Honestly, it was more of a quick glance üëÄ ‚Äî I might not be ready to build a full project yet, and I've already forgotten quite a bit üòÖ.

        Studied C, Python, data structures, and digital circuits.<br><br>
        Built a simple C-based management system as a course project. Though the code was bulky, I regret not learning how to publish it online at that time.
        Python was powerful but its numerous methods weren't very memory-friendly üòÖ.
        Digital circuits were fascinating with chips, though less enjoyable when dealing with oscilloscope configurations.

        Learned Visual Basic as part of a school course in Zhejiang Province. 
        It was a chosen elective subject for the Gaokao curriculum. Compared to NOIP in middle school, 
        it felt less challenging, focusing mostly on basic programming and simple algorithms, 
        but it helped solidify my understanding of programming fundamentals.

      description: |
        Participated in my first coding contest using C. I didn't win any prizes, 
        but I gained valuable experience in algorithms and problem-solving. Honestly, 
        after this contest I wasn't very interested in coding for a while. It felt a bit early for me, 
        and I didn't have a solid foundation yet. However, this experience made it much easier to learn programming later on.
